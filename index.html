	<h3> Tutorial </h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line baking sheets with parchment paper. </li>
	<li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, xanthan gum (leave out if your flour already has it), cocoa powder, and salt. </li>
	<li>In a large bowl cream the butter on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the sugar and brown sugar and beat until creamed, about 2 minutes.</li>
	<li>Add the egg yolk, milk, and pure vanilla extract, and beat on high speed until fully combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl if needed.</li>
	<li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until fully combined. </li>
	<li>Pour the gluten-free sprinkles into a small bowl.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<ol>
	<li> Step 1 <br>
	Scoop 1 tablespoon of dough and roll into a ball. (I used a cookie scoop.)</li>
	<li> Step 2 <br>
	Roll cookie dough ball in the sprinkles and place onto a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
	Bake for 10-12 minutes. (Please watch your cookies because every oven is different.)</li>
	As soon as you bring the cookies out of the oven place the unwrapped Hersey Kisses in the center of each cookie.</li>
	Allow to cool completely or the Hersey Kisses will flatten. Enjoy!</li>
	Store in an airtight container.</li>
	</ol>
